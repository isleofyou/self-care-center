# Self Care Center

## Overview
- This website application will give the user a mantra or an affirmation that can help clear their minds. 

## Features:
  - Allows users to receive a random mantra or affirmation. The user can also click the receive button repeatedly until they find one that they like. The form also includes a clear function to return to the original image. 


## Install and Setup :

## Wins:
  - A win from this project was matching the expected comp with limited CSS knowledge. This project allowed me to learn different tricks within CSS for centering, margins, borders, etc. 

## Challenges and improvements:
  - A challenge I faced during this project was correctly manipulating the DOM after a random mantra or affirmation was chosen. Every time one was chosen the text would appear off center. I learned that by adding a class name and a rule in CSS allowed things added after manipulation to follow styling rules.
